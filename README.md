# Latitude - Weather Relationship Analysis

The purpose of this project was to analyze how weather changes as one approaches the equator. To accomplish this goal, random latitude and longitude coordinates were generated programmtically and used with the [citypy](https://pypi.org/project/citipy/) python library to create a list of over 500 cities worldwide. Weather information for these locations was then retrieved from the [OpenWeatherMap API](https://openweathermap.org/) to create a weather dataset.

Using [matplotlib](https://pypi.org/project/matplotlib/) and the dataset, plots were made to visualize the relationship between latitude and various aspects of the weather. Factors studied included: maximum temperature, humidity, cloudiness, and wind speed. This site provides the source data and visualizations created as part of the analysis, as well as explanations and descriptions of any trends and correlations observed.
